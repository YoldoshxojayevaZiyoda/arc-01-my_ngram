## Welcome to Ngram project

## The task
my_ngram.The given code defines a function that takes command line arguments and calculates the frequency of each character in a concatenated string constructed from those arguments. The main function calls my_ngram and passes it command line arguments.

## Description

The my_ngram function in the provided code is implemented to calculate the frequency of each character in a given set of input strings. It uses an array called counts to store the occurrence count of each character.
The main function serves as an entry point to the program. It calls the my_ngram function, passing the command-line arguments argc and argv to it. Then, it returns 0 to indicate successful execution.


## Installation

To use this code, follow these steps:

Compile the code using a C compiler. Execute the compiled program with command-line arguments.
    ```
    gcc -o ngram my_ngram.c
    ```

## Usage
To use the my_ngram function in the provided code, you must compile and run the program with command line arguments. Here's how you can use it:
Any number of input strings can be provided as command-line arguments when running the program, and it will calculate the character frequency for all of them.
